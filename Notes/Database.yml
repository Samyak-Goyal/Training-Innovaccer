- What is Database?
  - database server - RDBMS type / NoSQL (eg. MongoDB)
    - SQL-91 is the standard to write the queries
    - database consists of
      - table
        - rows and colummns (a single column is a tuple)
  - products
    - postgresql, mysql, MariaDB, Oracle, MySQL server, Cassandra, MongoDB etc.


- installation of postgres
  - sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
  - wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  - sudo apt-get update
  - sudo apt-get -y install postgresql
  - sudop apt install postgtresql-contrib
  - to install pgadmin4 - the interface
    - curl https://www.pgadmin.org/static/packages_pgadmin_org.pub | sudo apt-key add
    - sudo sh -c 'echo "deb https://ftp.postgresql.org/pub/pgadmin/pgadmin4/apt/$(lsb_release -cs) pgadmin4 main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgadmin4.list && apt update'
    - sudo apt update
    - sudo apt install pgadmin4
    - sudo /usr/pgadmin4/bin/setup-web.sh
    - type http://127.0.0.1/pgadmin4 , to open pgadmin interface in browser
  - to setup sever in pgadmin4
    - sudo su - postgres
    - psql
    - create user <username> with password '<password>';
    - create databse <database_name>
    - grant all privileges on databse <databse_name> to <username>;
    - ALTER USER user_name CREATEDB CREATEROLE LOGIN; --> gives username permission to create database

- queries
  - create table
    create table roles(
      roleId SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      rolename varchar(255),
      datecreated date,
      isSystemRole bool
    )


    create table users(
      userId SERIAL,
      First_name varchar (50),
      Last_name varchar(50),
      roleId int REFERENCES roles(roleId)
    )
  - data types
    - int
    - float
    - decimal
    - char
    - varchar
    - date
    - timestamp
    - time
    - bool
    - enum ["val1", "val2"] -> provides choice between the values (more than 2 allowed options are there, then use enum)
  - insert
    insert into roles (roleId, rolename, datecreated, isSystemRole) values(1, 'admin', now(), true)
  - select
    - in production, dont use * instead if needed type all the column(s) name
  - auto increment
    - serial --> postgres
    - identity --> MsSQL
    - auto_increment --> mysql
  - relationship
    - primary key --> it is a unique key, can't be NULL. usually it is assigned to the ID of the table
    - foreign key
  - alter table
    alter table users add column emailId varchar(100) unique
    alter table users alter column emailId type varchar (150)
  - IN
  - NOT IN
  - select * from pg_database --> gives details about all the databases
  - SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' --> shows the tables and their details
  - select * from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'movies';  --> to describe a table
  - Wildcard character
    - * (of linux) == % in postgres, and mysql too
    - ? (of linux) == _ (underscore) in postgres
  - BETWEEN <DATE> AND <DATE> -->  same can be done with, >= <date> and <= <date>
    - better to use between..and, instead of logical operators. it is more optimised (in case of dates)
  - select * from <table> LIMIT 5 --> gives first 5 records
    - select * from <table> limit 5 offset 10 --> offset, so it removes first 10 characters and then shows 5 records
    - in mysql, select * from <table> limit 5,10 --> it starts from 5th record and shows the next 10 records
  - select * from <table> fetch first <n> row only --> gives the first n rows
    - select top 5 from <table> --> same as others, but in MsSQL
  - select * from <table> order by salary desc fetch first 5 row only  --> maximum 5 salary records, use this instead using order by limit, it is more optimal
  - select * from <table> offset 10 rows fetch first 10 rows only -> start with 11th row and display first 10 rows
  - to get the last row, order by <auto_incremented_column> desc
  - select distinct <column_name(s)> from <table> --> unique records wrt to the comboination of columns after distinct
  - select 'text1' || 'text2' as <column_alias> --> shows, text1text2 under column 'column_alias'
    - select concat(text1,text2) from <table> --> same as above
    - select concat_ws(' ', text1, text2) from <table> --> it takes the separator first and places it at the required location
  - aggregate functions
    - SUM, MAX, MIN, COUNT, AVG
    - select count(*) from <table> --> tell the no of records in the table
      - again, * will result into large time, we can use count(movie_id), like the index column, we will still get the same result
      - provide the alias ("as")
      - it will also neglect the null value, if count is used for a particular column. while using for * it counts null value too
    - select sum(column_name) from <table> --> returns the sum of the values of the mentioned column
    - select min(column_name) from <table> --> tells the minimum value from the column
    - select max(column_name) from <table> --> tells the maximum value from the column
    - select avg(column_name) from <table> --> tells the average value from the column
    - in case of null values, the above operation doesn;t count it, they just neglect it as it doesn't hold any value
  - group by
    - select <xxxxxx> from <table> group by <column_name> --> in place of xxxxx, use the column name used to group by, insted of *
    - we can also use two or more columns to group by
  - having
    - we can't use where with aggregate functions, so we use having
    - having is mainly used with group by
    - ...group by having count(column_name) >5 --> shows the records with count of the column name values >5
    - we can use where in combination with having, but where clause mustn't contain aggreagate function
  - select 1+2 as ans --> these kind of calculations are also possible
  - table relationships
    - one to one
    - one to many
    - many to many
  - JOINS
    - INNER join
      - select directors.director_id,
        directors.first_name,
        directors.last_name,
        movies.movie_name
        from directors
        inner join movies
        on directors.director_id = movies.director_id
        where movies.movie_lang = 'English'
      - select directors.director_id,
        directors.first_name,
        directors.last_name,
        movies.movie_name,
		    movie_revenues.domestic_takings
        from 
        directors

        inner join movies		
        on directors.director_id = movies.director_id 

        inner join movie_revenues on
        movies.movie_id = movie_revenues.movie_id
        --> the above is the method to join 3 tables, we have to type inner join separately and use on with it separately too
    - LEFT join
      - select d.director_id,
        d.first_name,
        d.last_name,
        mo.movie_name
        from directors d
        left join
        movies mo
        on d.director_id = mo.director_id
    - RIGHT join
      - select d.director_id,
        d.first_name,
        d.last_name,
        mo.movie_name
        from movies mo
        right join
        directors d
        on d.director_id = mo.director_id
    - FULL join
      - select d.director_id,
        d.first_name,
        d.last_name,
        mo.movie_name
        from movies mo
        full join
        directors d
        on d.director_id = mo.director_id
      - JOINS are more time efficient than subqueries
  - UNION
    - merge tables but the same column number from them
    - select first_name,last_name from actors UNION
      select first_name, last_name from directors
    - if there is a duplicacy in the tables, it shows one instance only
    - it is like the (U) symbol in mathematics
  - UNION ALL
    - it doesn't remove the duplicate values, it keeps them all
  - INTERSECT
    - it does the same function as the intersect in maths
    - select first_name from directors INTERSECT select first_name from actors
  - EXCEPT
    - just opposite of INTERSECT
    - select first_name from directors EXCEPT select first_name from actors
  - SUBQUERIES
    - non correlated subquery
      - select movie_name, movie_length from movies where movie_length > (select avg(movie_length) from movies)
        --> here we haven't hardcoded the avg value, instead we kept it dynamic
    - correlated subquery
      - select
        d1.first_name,
        d1.last_name,
        d1.date_of_birth,
        d1.nationality
        from directors d1
        where date_of_birth = (select min(date_of_birth) from directors d2 where d2.nationality=d1.nationality)
      - using IN
        - select movie_name from 
          movies
          where movie_id IN
          (select movie_id from movie_revenues where
            international_takings > domestic_takings)
          
          ALTERNATE to above command (not same result, just showing the use)

          select 
          mo.movie_id,
          mo.movie_name,
          d.first_name,
          d.last_name
          from movies mo
          join
          directors d
          on mo.director_id = d.director_id
          where movie_id IN
          (select movie_id from movie_revenues where
            international_takings > domestic_takings)
  - string functions
    - select 'daksh bindal' --> return daksh bindal
    - select UPPER('abc') --> uppercase
    - select LOWER("ABC") --> convert to lower case
    - select INITCAP('abc') --> capitalise initial letter for space separated keywords
      - also applicable to column of tables
    - select left('india',3) --> shows 3 characters from left
      - select left('india', -2) --> it will remove last 2 characters. and prints the remaining
    - select right('india',3) --> shows the right 3 characters, here 'dia'
    ---- space is included in both left and right
    - select reverse('india') --> reverses the string
    - select substring('india',x,y) --> starting from x, displays the next y characters (including xth letter). for first charcter x=1
    - select replace('i am from india','india','USA') --> original text, text to replace, text to replace with
    - select split_part('firstname.lastname@google.com','@',1) --> splits it into parts, the separator is @ (here),separator is not included anywhere, 1 is for showing the 1st part
    - select adte_of_birth::TEXT from directors --> coonvert dob which was originally date data type to text data type using the shown syntax

- TODO
  - find the optimisation techniques

# - to run
#   - sudo su - postgres
#   - psql


- JSON
  - JAVASCRIPT OBJECT NOTATION
  - In mongo db data is stored in json formal not in tabular format
  -
    [
      {
        'column1':value,
        'column2':value,
        'column3':value
      },
      {
        .......
      }
    ]
  - data in each curly bracket is row data
  - the above data is a text format of json
  - in JSONB, the data is stored in binary format, so it would be faster than the text format
  - select '{....}' --> the content inside the {} brackket is called json object which will be stored in the tuple as a text format
  - select '{"title":"i am iron man"}'::JSON --> this is the format if we want to convert text to json
  - if there are spaces in {} before "" then convert to jsonb format using ::jsonb
  - create table books(
      bookId serial primary key,
      bookinfo jsonb
    )
    insert into books (bookinfo) values ('{"title":"book 1"}')
    insert into books (bookinfo) values ('{"title":"book 2"}')
    insert into books (bookinfo) values ('{"title":"book 3"}')
    select * from books

    in this json object will be inserted into the table
  - select bookId, bookinfo->'title' from books --> this gives the value corresponding to the title in bookinfo column in the string format
  - select bookId, bookinfo->>'title' from books --> here it will give the content inside the value of the key
  - update books set bookinfo =bookinfo || '{"author":"authorname"}' where bookId=1 --> it will upodate
    - now if we will run this query again, we would not see other author key, but update the previous one
      this is only possible in postgre when done with json
  - update books set bookinfo = bookinfo || '{"author":"author 1", "category":"science"}' where bookinfo->> 'author'='authorname new' --> see the >> used, used to change the content
  - update books set bookinfo = bookinfo - 'category' where bookinfo->> 'author'='author 1' --> here the category key will be removed
  - to convert a simple rdbms table to format of json object
    - select row_to_json(directors) from directors
    - select row_to_json(mydirectors) from (select director_id, first_name, last_name from directors) as mydirectors
      --> it converts the specified column to json object only
  
- VIEWS
  - virtual representation of any statement and you give a particular name to that statement which act as virtual table where you can perform operations without affecting the actual table 
  - virtual table basically
  - create or replace view moviedetails as <query> --> creats a view
  - select * from moviedetails --> see the view
  - it basically behaves exactly like a table and doesn't bother the original tables
  - it has no physical presence
  - views cant be modified in postgres

- Triggers
  - a trigger is defined as any event that sets a course of sequence or action in a real time environment
  - events
    - insert, update, delete, truncate
    - when
      - before the event happens
      - after the event has happened
      - instead of the event,  we are bypassing the event and doing something of our own
    - level
      - table
      - row
  - triggers are applied on tables and views only
  - a FUNCTION is a logic which will be executed on triggered event
    - way to create function and trigger

      create table players(
        player_id serial primary key,
        name varchar(100)
      );
      
      create table players_audits(
        player_audit_id serial primary key,
        player_id int not null,
        name varchar(100),
        edit_date timestamp not null
      )

      insert into players (name) values('Virat Kohli');
      insert into players (name) values('Ms Dhoni');
      insert into players (name) values('Rohit sharma');

- MONGO DB
  - data is never stored in rows and column
  - maintained in json format
  - no need to establish relationship
  - collection==tables, document=row
  - collections are there, everything is clubbed into json format
  - the database style is known as NoSQL
  - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/ 
    - follow the above tutorial to install mongodb
    - the mongod stands for mongo+daemon
    - mongodb is the database
    - to start mongodb, type mongo in the terminal
    - there are 3 options for user interface; monogdb compass, robo3t/studio3t, shell/terminal
    - download robo3t or studio3t, robo is free version of studio
    - unzip the file and go to bin folder and run the robo3t script using ./robot3t, as it is an executable
      - give the chmod permissions if needed
    - do the formatlities
    - create a new connection, test it and connect it

  - working on mongodb
    - open terminal or open through right clicking on server menu and click open shell
    - use <db_name> --> switch to database, if doenst exists create the database
    - db.Employee.insertOne --> allows us to insert "one" record into the newly created table(employee)
