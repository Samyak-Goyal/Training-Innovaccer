- multiple data centres -> availibilty zone (AZ) -> Region
- register on aws console
- enter card details and do the formalities
- login as root user (if you are using your own account)
  - log in as IAM user if login-ing as an enterprise user

- EC2 
    - Elastic Cloud Compute
    - useful for mainly create instance
    - instance is basically a virtual machine, gives a server to us

  - creating and working with an INSTANCE
    - Launch Instances
    - for example lets create an ubuntu server
    - search for ubuntu, and select the version you want to install
    - as we are going with free version we will go with the free options that they are showing there
    - now we will be directed to various steps
    - select the instance in the 2nd step (t2.micro --> the free version)
    - the network details
    - the storage details (details of volume)
    - the tags
    - the secrity group
    - the final page
    - after clicking on launch, we will be seeing a prompt asking us to set up a private key
    - create the private key and then DOWNLOAD it for SURE, or else we will not be able to download it again
    - launch the instance
    - we will be seeing a lot of details of the instance that we created
    - we can set the name of the instance too
    - clicking on the instance id we will see a new dailog box with all the details of the instance
    - by default 22 port of the instance is allowed (for AWS)
    - if we want to add another port then we have to go to security group -> inbound port -> add <port> and 0.0.0.0/0
    - this way we will be allowed <port> at out public address of the instance
    - to connect to the server with a machine
    - go to connect tab at the dialog box, and follow the steps
      - go to the location where you downloaded the Key file
      - open the terminal and write --> chmod 400 <filename>
      - and then ssh -i "<filename>" ubuntu@<public_ip>
      - we will get connected to the server
    - we are inside the server and configure it as we wish

    - at the network stage, we scroll down and see the "user data" column, we can actually write a script there which will be initiated
      once the instance is connected to the ssh, like we can give commands to install some softwares so that we dont have to do that manually

  - NOTE : THAT WE RECIEVE ONLY 720 HOURS FREE PER MONTH, SO "STOP" THE INSTANCE WHEN NOT IN USE, JUST SHUTTING DOWN THE 
    MACHINE WONT HELP.

  - we can do the jenkins workflow that we did in the build and deploy in the build and deploy part, here instead of localhost:8080
    we will be getting <public_ip>:8080 , so this ip can be shared with other people
  
  - creating a VOLUME
        - the data that the instance holds is stored in a volume 
        - it is created in the "storage" step while creating the instance
        - we can create another volume and attach it to the instance
        - this basically works like an external hard drive that we use, but virtual
        - to attach the volume to the instance there must be some conditions satisfied
        - as the external hard drive must be at the same location as the PC, same the volume must be at the same availibity zone
        as the instance
        - here, as the availibility zone is like us-east-1b, so the AZ should be same for both volume and instance for them to get attached
        - now we can choose the AZ of volume while creating a volume as same as that of the instance
        - and if we want to choose that of instance, it can be done while creating the instance
        - at the network stage of creating the instance, in the subnet, select the same AZ as that of the volume and just proceed with the launch
        - now the volume can be attached

  - creating a snapshot
        - snapshot, as the name signifies, takes a snap of the volume/instance at that particular instance
        - lets say we have to shift our server from one region to another region due to any reason
        - we have to be able to carry all out data (volume) with us
        - the volume can't be attached to an instance out of their AZ, so snapshot come into play
        - we create a sanpshot of the volume
        - now we copy the snapshot at the desired AZ (able to choose while copying)
        - now we will change our zone
        - as we head to snapshot section we will be able to see our copied snapshot there
        - we create a volume out of the snapshot (go to actions)
        - now we see/note the AZ of the volume
        - as we create instance there, keep in mind to choose the subnet correctly
        - attach the volume and you will be able to get all the data in the instance

  - Elastic IP
        - EC2 service
        - create a public IP for yourself, which will be available for us always
        - it is paid

- S3
    - Scalable Storage Service
    - provides "unlimited" cloud storage
    - create bucket
    - create object, add files, add folders etc.
    - changing the permissions to make it accessible
        - go to the permissions of the bucket first
        - go to the block public access -> edit -> uncheck and save
        - scroll down, go to object ownership -> edit -> enable ACLs
        - go to the permissions of the object, and give read permissions to the the public etc.
    - we will be able to access the object with the url specified there
    - we need to edit the policy too
        - go to permissions of the bucket
        - scroll down to bucket policy
        - edit
        - policy generator
        - policy type -> s3 bucket
        - principal -> *
        - getObject
        - paste the arn from any object and add /*
        - generate
        - copy
        - paste it to previous page where we clicked policy generator
        - save and done
    
- Lambda
    - serverless functions -> if we want to execute some heavy functions (not neccessarily heavy) outside of our server
        as it is consuming a lot of our server, we deploy them on separate platform (called lambda in aws)
    - languages supported in lambda
        - Node
        - Python
        - Java 8+
        - C# .net core
        - Golang
        - Ruby
        - Rust (beta version)
    - go to service -> lambda -> functions -> create function
    - four options while creating
        - author from scratch -> start from scratch
        - use a blueprint -> create from already created functions
        - container image
        - Browse serverless app repositry -> some repos are already made, use them if you want to
    - create a functon, give name, and the language version (in author from scratch)
    - find the blueprint, and start working with it
    - function created
    - there will be a code written already if nlueprint is chosen (here we are choosing blueprint)
    - make changes
    - "Test" it, craete test event
    - test and the code will run
    - "Deploy" to save the changes made to the function
    - in configuration tab
        - there are various configs available
        - function url- new
            - to create a url for the function to make it accessible publicaly
    - in monitor tab
        - go to logs to see the logs of the function
    
    - the function:-
        console.log('Loading function');

        exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
            return{
                "statusCode" :200,
                "body": "This is another Nodejs function, changes made",
                "header":{
                    "Content-Type":"application/json"
                }
            }
        };


    - Limitations of Lambda
        - memory can be 128mb to 10gb
        - Max execution time- 15minutes (900 seconds)
        - max size of environment varaibles - 4kb
        - disk capacity - /tml - 512 mb
        - function can execute 1000 process concurrently

- DynamoDB
    - NoSQL database like MongoDB
    - create table and give name and partition key
    - keep the default settings
    - and create table
    - we can use all the filters and tables searching options making it easier to iterate the table

- API Gateway
    - creating APIs (may types REST, HTTP etc)
    - we link a lambda function with it
    - can create resource, the url endpoint
    - can create methods for resource -> get/put/post etc
    - can create stages, to test the API
    - enable CORS

- CloudWatch
    - used to watch over all the functionalities of our AWS, ranging from billing, ec2 instances, lambda fucntions etc
    - can create alarms, i.e. when certain thing happens we will recieve notification on mail or anything of our choice
    - we have to select the metric on which we want to apply the alarm
    - apply desrired conditions and the SNS topic
    - can create log groups to view the logs for various services
    - can create event rules, if we want to get some event happened
    - can create schedules, to automate something to happen after fixed interval of time

- Route 53
    - Domain registration and management system
    - creating records, create two records 
        - if domain is abc.com
        - then records will be 
            - www.abc.com
            - abc.com
        - link both of them with the server ip address
    - open the ec2 isntance from the terminal 
    - sudo apt-get install apache2
    - go to /etc/www
    - index.html will be there, if not create one
    - whatever will be there in the file, will be displayed on the webpage

- IAM
    - managing access to AWS resources
    - creating roles and users and granting them roles
    - create password based user

- RDS
    - Relational Database System
    - craete various databases from the AWS
